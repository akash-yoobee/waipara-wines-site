    We have three organic hillside vineyards on clay limestone soils in North Canterbury.

  <div>
    <h3 class="vineyard-info-card__h3">Our home vineyard</h3>
    <p>
      Our home vineyard is located six kilometres north east of the Waipara Junction in the Omihi subdistrict of Waipara Valley. <br>
      It has a northfacing slope and is situated on a sedimentary clay fan on a gentle hillside. The soil is mainly Awapuni clay loam with calcium carbonate deposits. <br>
      <em>Pinot Noir</em> is grown on a 3.8 hectare block here. It is predominantly an ungrafted 10-5 clone and was planted in 1994 at a vine density of 1841 vines per hectare.  <br>
      <em>Chardonnay</em> is grown on an adjacent 3.8 hectare block here. It is an ungrafted Mendoza Chardonnay vines and was planted in 1994 at a vine density of 1841 vines per hectare.

    <h3 class="vineyard-info-card__h3">Damsteep vineyard</h3>
    <p>
      Damsteep vineyard is located in the north east of Waipara Valley at the foot of the Omihi Saddle, ten kilometres north of our home vineyard. <br>
      <em>Pinot Noir</em> is grown here on a 5 hectare north east facing slope, with an altitude between 140 to 180 meters above the sea level. <br>
      <em>Riesling</em> is grown on a north facing slope below the pinot noir on a 2.2 hectare block. The soil is a very dense brown-orange clay, interbedded with sandstones and subordinate limestone horizons. <br>        
      Both the Pinot Noir and Riesling blocks have a vine density of more than 5000 vines per hectare.

  <div>
    <h3 class="vineyard-info-card__h3">Netherwood vineyard</h3>
    <p>
        The Netherwood vineyard was planted by Waipara wine pioneers Russell Black and Daniel Schuster in 1986. The soil is Waipara Greensand which is a green grey richly glauconitic sandstone. <br>
        <em>Pinot Noir</em> cuttings were planted here on their own roots and established and farmed without irrigation. <br>
        <em>Chardonnay</em> is grown on a 0.8 hectare block on a south facing hillside. The vines are a mass selection and thought to be cuttings of Mendoza Chardonnay. <br>
        The vine density is an estimated 5000 vines per hectare but Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are grown together so it is hard to tell the density of each kind.

      We are set on making our wines true to the place they grow.  
      The wine is made from simple good estate grown fruit, it is handpicked, 
      organic and biodynamic, with no additives or fining. 
      We use vineyard derived yeasts, minimal sulphur at bottling and where possible, no filtration. 
    <p>
      <br>
    <p>
      We have used organic and biodynamic practices since 2012 and are certified with BioGro.
