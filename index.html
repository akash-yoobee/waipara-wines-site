      <h3>Our wines</h3>
      <p>
          We're set on making our wines true to the place they grow. The winemaking is simple good estate grown fruit, organic & biodynamic, handpicked, vineyard derived yeasts, no additives or fining, minimal sulphur at bottling and where possible, no filtration. Then we have character.

        Stay at our beautiful bed & breakfast studio. Located on the ground floor of an architecturally designed building which also houses a lunch time restaurant (Cuisine Winery Restaurant of the Year 2017) at the opposite end. The views are vast, expanding from vineyards to the majestic Southern Alps. Complimentary light breakfast provisions are supplied. Takeaway meals can be before ordered before 4pm. The restaurant closes at 5pm so you'll have the place & sunset to yourselves.
